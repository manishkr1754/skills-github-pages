# Invaluable Industry 4.0 Experience @ Havells

With a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical and Automotive Engineering 
from Delhi Technological University, I kick-started my career by working with world class manufacturing company Havells in Consumer durable segment, particularly Home Appliances : Air-Conditioners. This gave me multi-functional experience with added exposure to large scale project and international collaboration with Kinte-China for Highly Automated AC Assembly line and DASSAULT SYSTEME for Manufacturing Execution System (MES) which resulted in Industry-first ‘Industry 4.0’ manufacturing plant (~500 Crores) for Havells-Lloyd ACs in Ghiloth, Rajasthan with high level of automation and robotic touch-points, providing superior product quality in the segment. As a result, we were able to produce every air conditioner in just 23 seconds significantly reducing the production time. The exceptional work done at this plant was even featured on Discovery The Great Indian Factory Season 2, titled "India's Most Advanced Robotic Air-Conditioner Manufacturing Plant". My experience with Havells has not only provided me with a strong foundation in the engineering field, but it has also given me the opportunity to work on innovative projects and make a significant impact in the industry.


# Pull Towards Public Service

As much as I enjoyed working with Havells,I always felt the pull towards public service which led me take a career gap after gaining invaluable industry experience in the field of Manufacturing & Operations and prepare for prestigious UPSC Civil Services Exam. While I was not successful in clearing the exam, experts in the UPSC field have commended my dedication and hard work as a UPSC contender. 


# Transition into Data Science @ Analytics Vidhya

After giving my best shot at the exam, I decided to explore other opportunities for growth and learning. This period allowed me to reflect on my professional journey and explore my interests, ultimately leading me to the exciting world of data science. Now, as a Data Science Professional at Analytics Vidhya(World Leading Data Science Community), I am thrilled to be part of a dynamic team that is at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field. I have honed my skills in various Data Science tools and Data Visualization platforms. With my strong business acumen, analytical skills and excellent communication abilities, I am committed to leveraging data driven insights to drive excellence and create meaningful impact.

My journey is a reminder that success is not just about achieving a particular goal but also about the lessons and experiences that come along the way. Setbacks and Failures are inevitable part of life but with courage, resilience and determination,one can overcome them and find their true calling. Through my journey, I have learned that being adaptable, willing to learn and embracing new challenges are key to success. As I continue to grow and learn in the field of Data Science, I am eager to make meaningful contributions to the world.
